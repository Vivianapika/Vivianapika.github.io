## Digital
Do I want to start the day by playing video games and scrolling the short videos or watching long videos? No I don't. I need some intervention. What can I do to help myself from doing it over and over again? How exactly? It's not fair.
Maybe one thing I can do is to start the day with reviewing my todoist list. I don't want to see stuff that is overdue to be honest.
