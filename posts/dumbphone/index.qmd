## Replace IPhone with dumbphones to cut screen time
This is my first step of digital declutter process. 
Do I want to start the day by playing video games and scrolling the short videos or watching long videos? No I don't. I need some intervention. What can I do to help myself from doing it over and over again? How exactly? 
Maybe one thing I can do is to start the day with reviewing my todoist list. I don't want to see stuff that is overdue to be honest.

My solution is to switch to a phone with smaller screen. So far it's the best option, because I had to have a working gps navigation for my car drive. And after I read about all the options for dumbphones, this phone jump out to me. I ordered this one and next step is to get rid of my iphone and ipod, once and for all. Most tasks can be done on my mac, and it'll be how it works. Including the todo list app I've been working with.

In order to get rid of iphone, what do I need to do?

- [x] deregister iMessage on both iphon and mac
- [x] unpair your Apple Watch
- [ ] backup the phone
- [ ] backup the wechat history
- [ ] manage wechat storage
- [ ] Let some people know that I will be switching to a non-Apple phone, and suggest them to send me SMS messages. WhatsApp is another alternative, but for long term solution would better be SMS, since it's going to be useful for a real dumbphone lifestyle.

I just pre-ordered Light phone 3 and hopefully it'll be my primary phone and Jelly Star can work as a secondary.
Remarkable2 is an almost perfect product but it doesn't support DRM protected ebooks.

## Prepare for the transition
Eventually the goal is to get rid of IPhone, because it's not good for my ADHD brain.

- [x] Apply greyscale color filters to display 
- [x] Delete all social media app and games (not sustainable for the following reasons)
    1. even though I know it's not healthy for me to install them back, but there is nothing to prevent me from installing them again, and it has happend to me numerous times
    2. some social media app I can't abandon completely because I might lose some contacts by doing that.
- [x] For social media app that has TikTok-like feature, delete them all and use website on mac if nessasary.

## To be continued
And ideally there should be a boring IPhone for people to customize with app store disable. FOMO or not, people should have to option to buy a dumb IPhone. More to come about what that ideal phone should look like. There are some underlying issue there along with it. It's going to be difficult to overlook.
