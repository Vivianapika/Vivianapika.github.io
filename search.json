In order to find the answer, she started to read her text messages between her mother in the middle of the night. It was a night without sleep, literally. As she read through the text messages, she started shaking. She was able to find the answer and something else she never expected.\nShe never had the patience to actually read previous text messages, since it felt too much work for her. This time she got off a weird phone call, on which her father were being so defensive, evasive and kept telling her she made that decision by herself 6 years ago. Her memory had been so blurry all the time and she never questioned her father before, so she took that as a fact. However, she couldn’t understand why she made that decision no matter how hard she tried to remember. She’d been living through several depression episodes over the last 6 years, she felt like it never left her. And a few darkest time periods were directly related to the decision 6 years ago. Since she believed that she made that decision by herself, hence it’s her fault, she believed she deserve it all, until she finished reading the messages that night."

She had always been told by her parents that she’s been so lucky to have them, that they gave her so much and not a lot parents can actually do that. Since then she had not asked money from her parents. They spent money on her education."
